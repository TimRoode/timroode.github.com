            <h3>Rolf Method FAQs</h3>
            <p>
              <b>What is Structural Integration/Rolf Method?</b>
            </p>
            <p>The Rolf Method of Structural Integration was introduced over fifty years
              ago by Dr. Ida P. Rolf with a primary focus on manipulating the muscular
              and connective tissues of the body into proper alignment for peak performance
              and health, including prevention and recovery from injury and stress reduction.
              Unlike forms of deep tissue massage, Rolfing returns the body to a state
              of balance by manipulating and increasing the elasticity of connective
              tissues that wrap around every bone and muscle, moving the body into the
              correct alignment for optimum posture and functioning.</p>
            <p>
              <b>What are the benefits of the Rolf Method?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Research has shown many physical and emotional health benefits from Rolfing
              including:
              <br> 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Easing chronic pain&nbsp;
                <br> 
              </li>
              <li>Reducing stress, increasing feelings of relaxation and well-being&nbsp;
                <br> 
              </li>
              <li>Improving and aligning posture&nbsp;
                <br> 
              </li>
              <li>Creating a more efficient use of muscles&nbsp;
                <br> 
              </li>
              <li>Increases elasticity in the connective tissue that wraps all muscle and
                bone.
                <br> 
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <b>Is there a difference between Structural Integration and Rolfing ®?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Rolf originally called her work Structural Integration. Later, her
              techniques became known as Rolfing ® and this term has been trademarked
              by a school for bodywork. Timothy Roode has been fortunate to learn Structural
              Integration from Ida Rolf's senior students who are dedicated to her original
              teachings at the Guild for Structural Integration in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
            <p>
              <b>What is the difference between the Rolf Method and Massage Therapy?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Massage Therapy is concerned with the relief of muscle tension and pain.
              Structural Intergration (Rolfing) changes the postural imbalances of the
              body to correct the sources of tension and pain. Rolfing isn't just a vigorous
              "deep-tissue" massage, Rolfing encourages the body to find new ways to
              organize and balance itself.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Who was Dr. Rolf?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Ida P. Rolf received her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia University
              in 1920 and furthered her knowledge of the body through her scientific
              work in organic chemistry at the Rockefeller Institute. Her extensive research
              for solutions to family health problems led her to examine many systems
              that studied the effect of structure on function, including yoga, osteopathy
              and chiropractic. This, together with her scientific education, her curiosity,
              her intrinsic knowledge and her hands-on experience, guided her to a new
              understanding of the value of structural order.
              <br> A system of work emerged which Dr. Rolf called Structural Integration.
              She discovered that she could achieve remarkable changes in posture and
              structure by manipulating the body's myofascial system, devoting her energy
              to creating a holistic system of soft tissue manipulation and movement
              education that organized the whole body in gravity.</p>
            <p>
              <b>What is the Rolf Method 10 series?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Rolfing is recommended in a series of ten sessions, each of which focuses
              on a different area of the body. Each session lasts approximately one hour
              and can be scheduled anywhere from one a week to one a month. During a
              session, the Practitioner will apply pressure to the myofascial tissue
              using his or her hands, arms, and sometimes elbow to carefully move the
              tissue. Ultimately the experience is meant to allow the client to achieve
              full body awareness. It is through this awareness, triggered by skillful
              tissue manipulation, that an individual can radically change his or her
              fundamental ease of movement.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Ten series - Can it possibly take fewer or more sessions?</b>
            </p>
            <p>The ten session format of Rolfing is designed to work on the whole body
              systematically to bring it to a higher level of balance. It is possible
              for some people to need more than ten sessions to achieve those objectives.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Does The Rolf Studio offer other forms of bodywork?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, Deep Tissue Massage and Active Assisted Stretching.</p>
            <p>Deep Tissue Massage releases the chronic patterns of tension in the body
              through slow strokes and deep finger pressure using oils and cream. Active
              Assisted Stretching is a facilitated form of stretching that provides lengthening
              of major muscle groups.</p>
